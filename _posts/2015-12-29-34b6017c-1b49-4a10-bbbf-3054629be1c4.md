Allan Myles is an Australian based photographer and cinematographer originally from Glasgow, Scotland. He set up his first photographic studio at the age of 21 -- the same year that he graduated from College. After emigrating to Perth, Australia, he quickly established his own studio and a loyal client base.Since then, Allan has been commissioned by top international companies around the world including Hong Kong Tourism, Mercedes, Nokia, Guinness, Toyota, Visa and Prudential.His photography has been heavily influenced by his global perspective and a desire to work with different mediums. His work is renowned for intelligently projecting mood and capturing unique perspective. He is equally comfortable shooting in a studio in Singapore as he is in the Mongolian desert.
